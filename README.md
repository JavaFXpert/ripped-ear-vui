# Ear Trainer: Ear Training with a Voice User Interface
Application that uses a voice user interface (VUI) exclusively to help the user with ear training.  The persona of the application is a friendly and encouraging coach.  The flow of conversation is intuitive, and encourages exploration of new concepts and training sessions.

Future considerations:

- Break the 13 interval playing into more than one set so that it doesn't have to take so long to load.  For example, categorize the intervals into major, minor, and perfect/tritone
- Store the user's progress, choosing intervals in which the user is least strong
- Add descending and harmonic intervals
